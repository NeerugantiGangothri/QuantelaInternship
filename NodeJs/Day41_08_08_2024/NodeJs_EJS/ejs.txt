EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. 
It's commonly used in Node.js applications to render HTML pages dynamically. 
EJS allows you to embed JavaScript code directly within your HTML, making it easy to create dynamic and data-driven web pages.

How EJS Works
EJS works by mixing HTML with special EJS tags that can include JavaScript code. 
When the template is rendered, the EJS tags are replaced with the appropriate JavaScript output.

EJS Tags
<%= %>: Outputs the value of the JavaScript expression, with escaping .
<%- %>: Outputs the value of the JavaScript expression without escaping.
<% %>: Executes the JavaScript code but does not output anything.



Explanation For Code:

Setting Up EJS: app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
This line tells Express to use EJS as the templating engine.

Rendering a Template: res.render('index', data);
This line renders the index.ejs template and passes the data object to it. 
The properties of the data object (title and message) are accessible in the template.
