Types of Streams:
Readable Streams: These streams let you read data from a source, like HTTP requests or file reads.

Example: fs.createReadStream() for reading files.
Writable Streams: These streams let you write data to a destination, like HTTP responses or file writes.

Example: fs.createWriteStream() for writing files.
Duplex Streams: These streams are both readable and writable.

Example: TCP sockets (net.Socket) are duplex streams.
Transform Streams: These are a special type of duplex stream where the output is computed based on the input.

Example: zlib.createGzip() for compressing data.
