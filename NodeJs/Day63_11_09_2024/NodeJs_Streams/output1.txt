TYPES OF STREAMS:
READABLE STREAMS: THESE STREAMS LET YOU READ DATA FROM A SOURCE, LIKE HTTP REQUESTS OR FILE READS.

EXAMPLE: FS.CREATEREADSTREAM() FOR READING FILES.
WRITABLE STREAMS: THESE STREAMS LET YOU WRITE DATA TO A DESTINATION, LIKE HTTP RESPONSES OR FILE WRITES.

EXAMPLE: FS.CREATEWRITESTREAM() FOR WRITING FILES.
DUPLEX STREAMS: THESE STREAMS ARE BOTH READABLE AND WRITABLE.

EXAMPLE: TCP SOCKETS (NET.SOCKET) ARE DUPLEX STREAMS.
TRANSFORM STREAMS: THESE ARE A SPECIAL TYPE OF DUPLEX STREAM WHERE THE OUTPUT IS COMPUTED BASED ON THE INPUT.

EXAMPLE: ZLIB.CREATEGZIP() FOR COMPRESSING DATA.
