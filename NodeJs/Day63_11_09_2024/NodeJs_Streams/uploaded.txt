Certainly! Here's a short English poem for a boy:

In a world so bright and full of joy,
There's a special little boy, oh boy!
With eyes that sparkle, a heart so pure,
His laughter and energy, we all adore.

He dreams of adventures, both near and far,
A brave young soul, like a shooting star.
With every step and every playful toy,
He brings endless wonder, our little boy.

So, may your days be filled with cheer,
As you grow each year, my dear.
In this journey of life, you'll find your way,
Our love for you will forever stay.

This poem is a simple tribute to the joy and wonder that a little boy brings to our lives. Feel free to personalize it further to suit the boy's name or specific qualities you'd like to highlight.
