How Session Management Is Useful:
Maintaining User State:
Sessions allow the server to remember information about a user across multiple HTTP requests. 
HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning each request/response cycle is independent of the other. 
With session management, we can persist data such as login status, shopping carts, preferences, etc., across different pages of a website.

Login/Logout:
session management helps track whether a user is logged in or not. 
Once a user logs in, their information is stored in the session and can be used to provide a personalized experience in future requests without asking the user to log in again.

Security:
Sessions also improve security by storing sensitive data (like login status) on the server instead of relying on cookies or other client-side mechanisms that might be more vulnerable to tampering. 
Even though session data is stored on the server, it can be easily accessed through the session ID stored in the user's cookie.

Scalability:
By using sessions, state information is stored server-side, meaning the application can maintain multiple concurrent users, each with their own independent session. 
The session middleware automatically manages this, ensuring data isolation between different users.
