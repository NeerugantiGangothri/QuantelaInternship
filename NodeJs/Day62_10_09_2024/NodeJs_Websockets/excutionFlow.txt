Client Side:
The user loads the page, which establishes a WebSocket connection (socket = io()).
The user types a message in the input field and clicks the "Send" button.
The JavaScript captures the message and emits a 'user-message' event to the server via WebSocket.

Server Side:
The server receives the 'user-message' event from the client.
The server broadcasts the message to all connected clients (using io.emit('message', message)), including the sender.

Back to Client Side:
Each connected client (including the sender) receives the broadcasted message through the 'message' event.
The message is appended to the chat-box in each client's UI, showing the sent message.
This two-way communication loop allows for real-time chat functionality.

Key Terminology:
The WebSocket connection is initiated when the page loads.
The message is sent from the client to the server using socket.emit().
The server broadcasts the message back to all clients using io.emit().
The clients receive the message and display it in the chat box.
