Excution Flow
Starting Point: app.js:

When you run node app.js in the terminal, Node.js starts executing app.js.

Require Statement:
Node.js encounters the require('./math') statement and starts executing math.js.

Execution of math.js:
In math.js, the add function is defined.
The add function is then assigned to module.exports.

Back to app.js:
The require('./math') statement in app.js evaluates to the add function from math.js.
Now, const math = require('./math'); means that math is the add function.

Calling the Function:
The math(2, 3) call in app.js is effectively calling the add function with the arguments 2 and 3.

Output:
The result of math(2, 3) is 5.
This result is then logged to the console with the message: "The Value is 5".
