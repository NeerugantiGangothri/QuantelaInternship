Cookies in Node.js are small pieces of data stored on the client side (in the browser) that are sent to the server with each HTTP request. 
They are useful for various purposes in web applications, including:

Session Management: Cookies can store a session ID or other tokens that help identify and manage user sessions. 
For example, after a user logs in, a cookie can store their session ID, allowing them to remain logged in as they navigate through different pages of the site.

User Preferences: Cookies can be used to remember user preferences or settings, such as language selection or theme choices, across sessions.

Tracking and Analytics: Cookies can track user activity on a site for analytics purposes, such as tracking how often a user visits certain pages or how long they stay on the site.

Authentication: Cookies can store authentication tokens, such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens), to handle user authentication and authorization.

res.cookie() is used to set a cookie.
req.cookies is used to read cookies sent by the client.



JWT VS COOKIES 

JWT (JSON Web Token) and cookie-based authentication are two popular methods for handling user authentication in web applications. 
While both can be used to manage sessions and secure communication between the client and server, they have different characteristics and use cases.

1. Storage Location
JWT-Based Authentication:
JWTs are typically stored in the client’s local storage or session storage, although they can also be stored in cookies.
When stored in local or session storage, they are sent manually with each request (usually in an HTTP header like Authorization: Bearer <token>).


Cookie-Based Authentication:
Cookies are stored in the browser and are automatically sent with every request to the server that set the cookie.
Cookies can store session IDs or JWTs and have attributes like httpOnly, secure, and SameSite to control their behavior.


2. Security Considerations

JWT-Based Authentication:
If stored in local or session storage, JWTs are vulnerable to XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks because JavaScript has access to the storage.
JWTs often include expiration times (exp claim) to mitigate risks if a token is compromised.
They are stateless, meaning the server does not need to store session information; it relies on the token’s integrity.

Cookie-Based Authentication:
Cookies can be made more secure using the httpOnly flag, which prevents JavaScript from accessing them, reducing XSS risks.
The secure flag ensures cookies are only sent over HTTPS, and the SameSite attribute helps prevent CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks.
Cookies require server-side storage for session data (unless they store a JWT), meaning they can be stateful.

3. Stateless vs. Stateful

JWT-Based Authentication:
JWTs are stateless by nature. Once issued, the server does not need to keep track of the token; it only needs to verify it using the secret key.
Statelessness makes JWTs highly scalable because the server doesn't store session data.

Cookie-Based Authentication:
Traditional cookie-based authentication is stateful, meaning session information (like session IDs) is stored on the server.
The server needs to manage and validate sessions, which can introduce scalability challenges, especially in distributed systems.

4. Use Cases

JWT-Based Authentication:
Suitable for API-based architectures, microservices, and mobile applications where a stateless mechanism is preferred.
Ideal for Single Page Applications (SPAs) where you want to avoid relying on server-side session storage.

Cookie-Based Authentication:
Common in traditional web applications where server-side session management is straightforward.
Useful when you need to handle complex session management or integrate with legacy systems that rely on cookies.

5. Expiration and Token Management

JWT-Based Authentication:
JWTs can include expiration (exp) and issued-at (iat) claims to manage token lifecycle.
Token renewal or rotation is more manual and may require additional endpoints for refreshing tokens.

Cookie-Based Authentication:
Cookies can be set with expiration times, and session expiration is managed on the server.
Expired sessions typically involve redirecting the user to a login page, making it simpler in some cases.

6. Implementation Complexity

JWT-Based Authentication:
Implementing JWTs requires understanding token creation, signing, and verification processes.
Managing token expiration and rotation can add complexity, especially in a distributed environment.

Cookie-Based Authentication:
Simpler to implement in many cases, especially if using built-in session management provided by frameworks like Express.js.
Less overhead in terms of token management, but can be less scalable due to the stateful nature.

Summary
JWT is best for stateless, scalable, and API-driven applications where tokens are passed with requests manually.
Cookies are better suited for traditional web applications where automatic handling of session data is needed, with security controls like httpOnly and secure flags for enhanced protection
