Express
Multer: Middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is used for file uploads.
Installation: npm install multer

Upload Route:
Purpose: Handle incoming file uploads.
Method: POST request.
Use multer to handle file upload and save it to the server.

Download Route:
Purpose: Serve files for download.
Method: GET request.
Use Express to serve static files from a directory or use res.download() to send files directly.

Setting Of Multer Storage:
Multer requires a storage engine to store uploaded files. There are several storage engines available, including local
storage, disk storage, and gridfs storage.

Disk Storage:
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
    destination: (req, file, cb) => {
        cb(null, 'uploads/');
    },
    filename: (req, file, cb) => {
        cb(null, file.fieldname + '-' + Date.now() + path.extname(file.originalname));
    }
});

Usage: This is the most common storage engine used when you want to save files locally on the server.
Configuration: You can configure DiskStorage by specifying the destination (where to save the files) and filename (what to name the files).
