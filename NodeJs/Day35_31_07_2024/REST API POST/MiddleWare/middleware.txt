Middleware in Node.js, especially within the context of Express.js, refers to functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), 
and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.
Middleware functions can perform various tasks, such as executing code, making changes to the request and response objects, ending the request-response cycle, and calling the next middleware function.

Types of Middleware
Application-level Middleware: Bind middleware to an instance of express() using app.use() or app.METHOD(), where METHOD is the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST).
Router-level Middleware: Bind middleware to an instance of express.Router().
Error-handling Middleware: Handle errors that occur during the request-response cycle.
Built-in Middleware: Provided by Express.js to handle common tasks (e.g., serving static files).
Third-party Middleware: Provided by third-party packages to extend functionality.
