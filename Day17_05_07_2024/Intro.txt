JavaScript includes features of sending asynchronous http request using XMLHttpRequest object.
Ajax is about using this ability of JavaScript to send asynchronous http request 
and get the xml data as a response (also in other formats) and update the part of a web page (using JavaScript) without reloading or refreshing entire web page.

AJAX is a new technique for creating better, faster, and more interactive web applications with the help of XML, HTML, CSS, and Java Script

Sending an XMLHttpRequest
A common JavaScript syntax for using the XMLHttpRequest

var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
 if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
 // Typical action to be performed when the document is ready:
 document.getElementById(“demo”).innerHTML = xhttp.responseText;
 }
};
xhttp.open(“GET”, “filename”, true);
xhttp.send();

Explainatin:
The first line in the example above creates an XMLHttpRequest object:

var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();

The onreadystatechange property specifies a function to be executed every time the status of the XMLHttpRequest object changes:
xhttp.onreadystatechange = function()

if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200)
The readyState==4 and status==200 states that response is ready

The responseText property returns the server response as a text string.
The text string can be used to update a web page:
document.getElementById(“demo”).innerHTML = xhttp.responseText;

The onreadystatechange Property:
The readyState property holds the status of the XMLHttpRequest.
The onreadystatechange property defines a function to be executed when the readyState changes.
The status property and the statusText property holds the status of the XMLHttpRequest object.
Ready State :
Holds the status of the XMLHttpRequest.

0: request not initialized
1: server connection established
2: request received
3: processing request
4: request finished and response is readystatus
status :
100: "Continue"
200: "OK"
400: "Bad Request"
401: "Unauthorized"
403: "Forbidden"
404: "Page not found"
500: "Internal Server Error"
statusText :
Returns the status-text

“OK”
“Not Found”
The onreadystatechange function is called every time the readyState changes.

Methods :
The jQuery library includes various methods to send Ajax requests. These methods internally use XMLHttpRequest object of JavaScript.

ajax() : Sends asynchronous http request to the server .
get() : Sends http GET request to load the data from the server .
Post() : Sends http POST request to submit or load the data to the server.
delete() : Sends http delete request to delete the data from server.
update() : Sends http update request to update the data from server.
