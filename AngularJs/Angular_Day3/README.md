# ANGULAR 17 

In Angular 17, there are some significant changes and improvements compared to earlier versions. A major shift has been towards simplifying the project structure by reducing the need for some traditional files like AppModule and AppRoutingModule, which were core to Angular applications in previous versions. 

Key Differences Between Angular 17 and Previous Versions
## 1. Standalone Components
One of the biggest changes in Angular 17 is the move towards standalone components, which eliminates the need for NgModules in many cases. Prior to Angular 14, every component had to be declared inside a module (AppModule), but in Angular 17, this is no longer necessary.

Previous Versions:

You needed an app.module.ts file to declare components, directives, pipes, and import other modules.
Every route or component had to be registered inside the module file.

Angular 17:

Components can be created as standalone components using the standalone: true property in the @Component decorator, removing the need for modules like AppModule.
Standalone components can directly import other Angular modules or services and configure routes within the component itself.

Example of a standalone component:
typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-component1',
  templateUrl: './component1.component.html',
  standalone: true // Standalone component
})
export class Component1Component {}

## 2. Simplified Routing (No More AppRoutingModule)
In previous versions, routing was typically handled by defining a separate AppRoutingModule. This routing module was responsible for importing the RouterModule and configuring the routes for your application.

Previous Versions:

Required an app-routing.module.ts file, where routes were declared using the RouterModule.forRoot(routes) method.
This routing module was then imported into the AppModule.

Angular 17:

Routes can now be defined directly within configuration files like app.config.ts (or even in the component files themselves).
This is done using the provideRouter() function, which removes the need for a dedicated routing module.
Example in app.config.ts:

typescript
import { provideRouter } from '@angular/router';
import { Component1Component } from './component1/component1.component';

export const appConfig = [
  provideRouter([
    { path: 'component1', component: Component1Component }
  ])
];

## 3. No More AppModule
With Angular 17, the concept of the AppModule has been de-emphasized. Instead of the traditional module-based structure, applications are often bootstrapped using standalone components and a configuration-based approach.

Previous Versions:

Every application required an AppModule for bootstrapping the root component (AppComponent).
The AppModule was responsible for declaring components, importing modules, and setting up the root of the application.

Angular 17:

You no longer need an AppModule. Instead, you can bootstrap the application using bootstrapApplication() in main.ts.
Configuration and providers are passed directly to the bootstrapApplication() method, streamlining the startup process.
Example in main.ts:

typescript
import { bootstrapApplication } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { AppComponent } from './app/app.component';
import { appConfig } from './app/app.config';

bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [appConfig]
});

## 4. Smaller Bundles and Better Performance
With the move towards standalone components and the reduction of boilerplate code (like AppModule and AppRoutingModule), Angular 17 provides smaller bundle sizes and faster loading times.
By eliminating the need for a large number of imports and configurations at the module level, Angular 17 reduces the overhead and improves performance.

## 5. Improved Developer Experience

Angular 17 brings improvements like:

More declarative API for routes and bootstrapping.
Simplified structure that allows developers to work more modularly without being tied to module declarations.
Faster development with less boilerplate code and simpler setup.
Why AppModule and AppRoutingModule are Not Present in Angular 17

The absence of AppModule and AppRoutingModule is due to Angularâ€™s move towards modularity and simplicity:

Standalone Components allow you to directly declare components without the need for an AppModule.
Direct Routing with provideRouter() makes AppRoutingModule unnecessary, as routes are defined within configuration files or even component files.
This new approach makes Angular applications more modular, faster, and simpler to maintain, as you no longer need large module files to manage your app's structure.
