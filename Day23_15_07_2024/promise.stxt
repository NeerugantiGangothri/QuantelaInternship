In JavaScript, a Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. 
It is a way to handle asynchronous code more effectively, avoiding the "callback hell."

Key Concepts of Promises
Creation: A Promise can be created using the Promise constructor. It takes a function with two arguments, resolve and reject.
States:
Pending: Initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
Fulfilled: Operation completed successfully.
Rejected: Operation failed.
Syntax:
let myPromise = new Promise(function(myResolve, myReject) {
// "Producing Code" (May take some time)

  myResolve(); // when successful
  myReject();  // when error
});

// "Consuming Code" (Must wait for a fulfilled Promise)
myPromise.then(
  function(value) { /* code if successful */ },
  function(error) { /* code if some error */ }
);
