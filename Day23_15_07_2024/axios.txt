Axios is a third-party HTTP client library for making network requests.
It is promise-based and provides a clean and consistent API for handling requests and responses.
We can add it to your project via a content distribution network (CDN) or by using a package manager (like npm). 
Some of its core features include:
 making XMLHttpRequests within a browser, 
 making http requests within a node.js environment, 
 canceling requests, and intercepting request and response.


Axios simplifies HTTP requests with a chainable API which allows for straightforward configuration of 
request parameters, such as headers, data, and request method.
